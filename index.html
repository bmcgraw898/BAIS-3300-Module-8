        <h2>About Blaine</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Alburnett, Iowa a small town just north of Cedar Rapids. 
            I am currently 21 years old and a student here at the University of Iowa. 
            Where I am getting my BBA in Business Analytics and information systems. 
            I come from a large family of 6 siblings which all of them are adopted except for me. 
            Along with that my family has three dogs Mabel, Maggie, and Liberty. 
            I currently work at Hy-Vee as a service manager and have held many other jobs including being a stocker at Hy-Vee, a pollinator at Corteva Agriscience, and a convienence store worker at the University's Clinton Market Street. </p>
            
            <p> There are many things I enjoy and like to do in my free time. 
                One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music. 
                My favorite genre is hip hop and more specifically trap music. 
                My favorite artists include Travis Scott, Lil Tecca, Yeat, and Playboi Carti. 
                I also enjoy going to concerts and festivals. 
                I have seen Travis Scott perform live on his tour as well as going to Summer Smash in 2024.
                I also enjoy gaming as this past summer I built my own gaming PC where I play games like Valorant, Minecraft, and Fortnite.
                I also enjoy playing Clash Royale as well.  
            </p>
            <p>I am also very fond of sports. I am a huge Iowa fan for all sports from football to wrestling I am always cheering on the Hawks. 
                My favorite sports to watch are football, wrestling, basketball, and baseball. I got my love for watching sports from playing them back in high school and my youth. 
                In high school I did cross country, football, wrestling, track, and baseball. Though by the time it was all said and done my favorite sports to participate in were wrestling and baseball.
